## Analytics on your laptop with ClickHouse Local

Although ClickHouse is usually used for large-scale data analytics with lots of concurrent users, we can also use it to run analytics from our laptop with ClickHouse local. 
In this talk I'll give an introduction to ClickHouse and its use cases, before showing how to analyse data both on my machine and from the internet if the WiFi treats us well!

```bash
curl https://clickhouse.com/ | sh
```
